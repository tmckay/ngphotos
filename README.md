# ngphotos (Next Generation Photos)

# What
Most photo albums are static and are grouped based on time or a particular event. ngphotos takes
a different approach by emphasizing photo tagging and turning complex queries into albums.

Example queries:
 - Show me all pictures of my wife and our daughter when she was between 6 and 12 months old 
 - Show me all pictures of me and my spouse on the beach during the months of summer before 2012
 - Show me funny pictures of my friend and me

# Tags
Each photo will be tagged manually with the assistance of an app that will assist in tags and even recommend tags.

# Queries
Indexes will be generated with the tags and used to generate queries.

First iteration of queries will be SQL. Possibility for a different DSL later.
